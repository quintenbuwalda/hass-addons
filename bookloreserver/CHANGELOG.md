## 2.0.1
- Update BookLore Version from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
- Updated Config to use USER_ID: "0" and GROUP_ID: "0". This seems to have fixed an issue with new users being unable to start the service.
- Updated DATABASE_URL based on a user suggestion to use the internal home assistant docker network. Thank you @Antexa.
  - Now the default is jdbc:mariadb://core-mariadb:3306/booklore?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8mb4
    - This approach is more secure because the MariaDB port does not need to be exposed to the LAN.
